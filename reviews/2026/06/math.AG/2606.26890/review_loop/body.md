## **Introduction**

The central theme of this article concerns the generalized Zariski
cancellation problem. Given algebraic varieties $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ over a
field $k$, this problem asks whether $$X\times Z \cong_k Y\times Z
\implies
X\cong_k Y$$ as $k$-varieties. The classical Zariski cancellation
problem corresponds to the special case $Z=\mathbf{A}^1_k$. The
behaviour of cancellation is remarkably subtle. While positive results
are known in several situations---for instance, Fujita [@Fuj1979] proved
cancellation for the affine plane $\mathbf{A}^2_k$ over any field of
characteristic zero---the answer is negative in general. In [@Dan1989],
Danielewski introduced a family of complex hypersurfaces
$$D_n:=V(x_1^n x_2+x_3^2+1)\subseteq \mathbf{A}^3_\mathbf{C},$$ showing
that
$D_1\times\mathbf{A}^1_\mathbf{C}\cong_\mathbf{C}D_n\times\mathbf{A}^1_\mathbf{C}$
for every $n\in\mathbf{N}$, i.e., all
$\mathbf{A}^1_\mathbf{C}$-cylinders over the $D_n$ are isomorphic.
Motivated by Zariski cancellation, one may ask whether the surfaces
$D_n$ are pairwise non-isomorphic. Fieseler [@Fie1994] answered this
affirmatively by distinguishing them via their homology groups at
infinity. Consequently, the family $\{D_n\}_{n\in\mathbf{N}}$ provides
counterexamples to the classical Zariski cancellation problem.

Over $\mathbf{C}$, cancellation has also been studied in complex
analytic geometry with respect to analytic isomorphism equivalence. In
the global analytic setting, the answer is negative in general: Shioda
[@Shi1977] constructed pairwise non-isomorphic elliptic curves $E$,
$E_1$, and $E_2$ such that $E_1\times E\cong E_2\times E$. On the other
hand, in the category of complete varieties, $X\times Z\cong Y\times Z$
entails $X\cong Y$, provided that $Z$ is projective and either the pair
$(X,Z)$ or the pair $(Y,Z)$ is Picard-independent (see [@Fuj1981]). By
contrast, in the local analytic setting, Hauser and Müller [@HM1990
Theorem 1] established generalized cancellation for complex analytic
space germs. This result, together with their unique factorization
theorem for algebroid spaces (see
Section [2.3](#subse2.3){reference-type="ref" reference="subse2.3"}),
forms a key ingredient of the present work.

The first main result of this article establishes a generalized
cancellation theorem for affine varieties admitting good
$\mathbf{C}^*$-actions and having an isolated singularity.

::: {#thm:mainA .mainthm}
**Theorem 1** (cf. Theorem
[13](#Thm: Our main cancellation theorem for C*-varieties){reference-type="ref"
reference="Thm: Our main cancellation theorem for C*-varieties"}). *Let
$R$ and $S$ be positively graded affine domains over $\mathbf{C}$. Let
$V:=\operatorname{Spec}R$ and $W:=\operatorname{Spec}S$ be the
corresponding complex affine irreducible varieties admitting good
$\mathbf{C}^*$-actions with vertices $p$ and $q$, respectively. Assume
that $p$ and $q$ are the unique singularities of $V$ and $W$,
respectively. Let $Z$ be a separated scheme over $\mathbf{C}$ (not
necessarily connected) having a smooth point such that
$$V\times Z \cong_{\mathbf{C}} W\times Z.$$ Then $V$ and $W$ are
isomorphic as complex affine varieties (not necessarily as
$\mathbf{C}^*$-varieties).*
:::

A particularly striking application of
Theorem [1](#thm:mainA){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:mainA"}
concerns Brieskorn--Pham varieties.

Let $k$ be a field of characteristic zero, not necessarily algebraically
closed. For $n\geq 2$ and an $n$-tuple
$\mathbf{a}=(a_1,\ldots,a_n)\in(\mathbf{N}_{\geq 2})^n$, consider the
affine $k$-algebra $$B_{\mathbf{a},k}:=
\frac{k[X_1,\ldots,X_n]}{(X_1^{a_1}+\cdots+X_n^{a_n})},$$ called a
*Brieskorn--Pham hypersurface ring over $k$*. The associated affine
hypersurface
$$V_{\mathbf{a},k}:=\operatorname{Spec}(B_{\mathbf{a},k})\subseteq \mathbf{A}^n_k$$
is called the *Brieskorn--Pham variety over $k$* corresponding to the
exponent tuple $\mathbf{a}$. We sometimes denote the defining polynomial
by $f_\mathbf{a}$, often referred to as the *Brieskorn polynomial*
associated to $\mathbf{a}$. Throughout this article, we may omit the
phrase "over $k$" whenever the ground field is clear from the context
and denote the corresponding variety simply by $V_\mathbf{a}$ instead of
$V_{\mathbf{a},k}$.

By the Jacobian criterion, $V_{\mathbf{a},k}$ has a unique singular
point at the origin, denoted by $\mathbf{0}_{\mathbf{a},k}$. Moreover,
$V_{\mathbf{a},k}$ is normal whenever $n\geq 3$, whereas it is
non-normal when $n=2$. Brieskorn--Pham varieties need not be
irreducible; for example, $V_{(2,2),k}$ is reducible whenever
$k\supseteq \mathbb{Q}(i)$.

When $k$ is not algebraically closed, it is often more natural to regard
$V_{\mathbf{a},k}$ as the affine $k$-scheme
$\operatorname{Spec}(B_{\mathbf{a},k})$ rather than through its set of
$k$-rational points, since the latter may be very small. For instance,
if $k=\mathbf{R}$, then $$V_{(2,2,\ldots,2),\mathbf{R}}
=\operatorname{Spec}\left(
\frac{\mathbf{R}[X_1,\ldots,X_n]}
{(X_1^2+\cdots+X_n^2)}
\right)$$ has a unique $\mathbf{R}$-rational point, namely the origin.
Accordingly, throughout this article, by a *variety* over a field $k$ we
mean a reduced separated scheme of finite type over $k$, and
irreducibility will be imposed only when explicitly stated. In
particular, we shall continue to refer to
$\operatorname{Spec}(B_{\mathbf{a},k})$ as a Brieskorn--Pham variety.

When $k=\mathbf{C}$, Brieskorn--Pham varieties form a classical family
of isolated hypersurface singularities that have been extensively
studied from topological, differential-geometric, analytic, metric, and
motivic viewpoints. Their links, Milnor fibers, monodromy operators,
mixed Hodge structures, and related invariants play prominent roles in
singularity theory.

Our next main result shows that Brieskorn--Pham varieties satisfy a
strong form of generalized Zariski cancellation. Indeed, cancellation by
any complex algebraic variety possessing a smooth point completely
determines the exponent tuple. More precisely:

::: {#thm:mainB .mainthm}
**Theorem 2** (cf.
Theorem [14](#Thm: Our main cancellation theorem for B-P varieties){reference-type="ref"
reference="Thm: Our main cancellation theorem for B-P varieties"}). *Let
$n\geq 2$, and let $V_\mathbf{a}$ and $V_\mathbf{b}$ be two
Brieskorn--Pham varieties defined over $\mathbf{C}$ corresponding to two
tuples $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\in(\mathbf{N}_{\geq 2})^n$. Then, for any
separated $\mathbf{C}$-scheme $Z$ (not necessarily connected) having a
smooth point, the following are equivalent:*

1.  *$V_\mathbf{a}\times Z\cong_{\mathbf{C}} V_\mathbf{b}\times Z$;*

2.  *$V_\mathbf{a}\cong_{\mathbf{C}} V_\mathbf{b}$;*

3.  *$V_\mathbf{a}$ and $V_\mathbf{b}$ are isomorphic as
    $\mathbf{C}^*$-varieties;*

4.  *$\mathbf{a}\sim \mathbf{b}$;*

*where $\mathbf{a}\sim\mathbf{b}$ denotes equality up to permutation of
entries.*
:::

When $k=\mathbf{C}$, we also consider the associated analytic germ and
formal completion at the singular point $\mathbf{0}_{\mathbf{a}}$,
namely $$V^{\rm an}_\mathbf{a}:=(V_\mathbf{a},\mathbf{0}_\mathbf{a})
\quad \text{and} \quad
\widehat{V}_\mathbf{a}:=\widehat{(V_\mathbf{a},\mathbf{0}_\mathbf{a})},$$
respectively defined by the local algebras $$B^{\rm an}_\mathbf{a}
=
\frac{\mathbf{C}\{X_1,\ldots,X_n\}}{(X_1^{a_1}+\cdots+X_n^{a_n})}
\quad \text{and} \quad
\widehat{B}_\mathbf{a}
=
\frac{\mathbf{C}[\![X_1,\ldots,X_n]\!]}{(X_1^{a_1}+\cdots+X_n^{a_n})}.$$

The extent to which the exponent tuple can be recovered from geometric
structures associated with a Brieskorn--Pham variety is a natural and
subtle question. Several rigidity phenomena of this type are already
known. According to Milnor [@Mil1968], every isolated hypersurface
singularity possesses a well-defined embedded topological type and an
associated algebraic knot. For complex Brieskorn--Pham singularities, a
theorem of Yoshinaga--Suzuki [@YS1978] (see also [@Yos1983 Corollary])
shows that the topological type determines the exponent tuple: if the
germs $(V_{\mathbf{a}},\mathbf{0}_{\mathbf{a}})$ and
$(V_{\mathbf{b}},\mathbf{0}_{\mathbf{b}})$ are homeomorphic, then
$\mathbf{a}\sim\mathbf{b}$. In [@BS2011], the authors proved that two
Brieskorn polynomials $f_\mathbf{a}$ and $f_\mathbf{b}$ have cobordant
algebraic knots if and only if $\mathbf{a}\sim\mathbf{b}$, provided that
no exponent is a multiple of another for either polynomial. More
recently, Fernández--Jelonek--Sampaio [@FJS2024_arxiv] showed that
bi-Lipschitz equivalence of the analytic germs
$(V_{\mathbf{a}},\mathbf{0}_{\mathbf{a}})$ and
$(V_{\mathbf{b}},\mathbf{0}_{\mathbf{b}})$ forces the smallest exponents
of $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ to coincide and occur with the same
multiplicity. Over the real numbers, Campesato [@Cam2018] proved that
the arc-analytic equivalence class of a Brieskorn polynomial determines
its exponents, describing this result as an analogue of the
Yoshinaga--Suzuki theorem over $\mathbf{R}$.

These results should be contrasted with the behaviour of substantially
weaker invariants. The topology of the link alone does not determine the
exponent tuple. Indeed, Yoshinaga exhibited infinite families of
Brieskorn--Pham singularities with pairwise distinct exponent tuples
whose links are all homeomorphic to topological spheres (see [@Yos1983
Examples 1, 2]). Since the smooth locus
$V_{\mathbf{a}}^{\mathrm{sm}}:=V_{\mathbf{a}}\setminus \{\mathbf{0}_{\mathbf{a}}\}$
is diffeomorphic to $L_{\mathbf{a}}\times(0,\infty)$, where
$L_{\mathbf{a}}$ denotes the link of the singularity
$(V_{\mathbf{a}},\mathbf{0}_{\mathbf{a}})$, the smooth locus and the
link have the same homotopy type. Consequently, neither the topology of
the link nor the homotopy type of the smooth locus determines the
exponent tuple in general.

Motivated by these rigidity phenomena, we show that the exponent tuple
is also completely determined by the algebraic, analytic, and formal
structures naturally associated with a Brieskorn--Pham variety. More
precisely, a key ingredient in the proof of
Theorem [2](#thm:mainB){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:mainB"} is
the following exponent rigidity theorem.

#### Strategy of the proofs and organization of the paper

The paper is organized as follows.
Section [2](#se2){reference-type="ref" reference="se2"} collects the
necessary preliminaries concerning Brieskorn--Pham varieties, the good
$\mathbf{G}_{m,k}$-actions they admit, complex analytic germs and
algebroid spaces, and the analytic cancellation theorem of
Hauser--Müller. The proofs of the main results are presented in
Section [3](#se3){reference-type="ref" reference="se3"} according to
their logical dependencies rather than the order in which the results
are stated in the Introduction.

We begin in Subsection [3.1](#subse3.1){reference-type="ref"
reference="subse3.1"} by proving exponent rigidity for Brieskorn--Pham
varieties over an arbitrary field of characteristic zero
(Theorem [3](#thm:mainC){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:mainC"}).
This is achieved by studying certain zero-dimensional complete
intersection schemes arising from the Jacobian ideals of Brieskorn--Pham
hypersurfaces and showing, via a Hilbert series argument, that the
associated coordinate rings determine the exponent tuple.

Next, in Subsection [3.2](#subse3.2){reference-type="ref"
reference="subse3.2"}, we establish an analytic reduction theorem for
cylinder isomorphisms. More precisely, we show that if two complex
algebraic varieties with a unique singular point become isomorphic after
taking a product with an arbitrary complex algebraic variety having a
smooth point, then the corresponding complex analytic germs at their
unique singular points are analytically isomorphic. The proof relies on
the analytic cancellation and unique factorization theorems of
Hauser--Müller for algebroid spaces, together with Artin's approximation
theorem. We then combine this result with a theorem of R. V. Gurjar to
establish a generalized Zariski cancellation theorem for complex affine
irreducible varieties admitting good $\mathbf{C}^*$-actions and having a
unique singularity (Theorem [1](#thm:mainA){reference-type="ref"
reference="thm:mainA"}).

Finally, in Subsection [3.3](#subse3.3){reference-type="ref"
reference="subse3.3"}, we establish the generalized Zariski cancellation
theorem for Brieskorn--Pham varieties
(Theorem [2](#thm:mainB){reference-type="ref" reference="thm:mainB"}) by
combining the exponent rigidity theorem with the analytic reduction
theorem established earlier. This theorem constitutes the main
culmination of the paper.

## **Preliminaries**

### Good $\mathbf{G}_{m,k}$-actions on Brieskorn--Pham varieties {#subse2.1}

For a field $k$, let $\mathbf{G}_{m,k}:=\operatorname{Spec}k[T,T^{-1}]$
denote the multiplicative group scheme over $k$. Recall that an
effective $\mathbf{G}_{m,k}$-action on an affine variety
$V=\operatorname{Spec}A$ is called *good* if there exists a unique fixed
point $v\in V$, called the *vertex*, such that $v$ belongs to the
closure of every $\mathbf{G}_{m,k}$-orbit. Since a
$\mathbf{G}_{m,k}$-action on $V$ is equivalent to a $\mathbf{Z}$-grading
of the coordinate ring $A$, the action is good if and only if the
induced grading $A=\bigoplus_{d\in\mathbf{Z}}A_d$ is positive and
satisfies $A_0=k$. Equivalently, the irrelevant ideal
$A_+:=\bigoplus_{d>0}A_d$ is the unique homogeneous maximal ideal of
$A$, corresponding to the fixed point $v$.

Let $k$ be an arbitrary field, let $n\geq 2$, and let
$\mathbf{a}=(a_1,\ldots,a_n)\in(\mathbf{N}_{\geq 2})^n$. Put
$$N:=\operatorname{lcm}(a_1,\ldots,a_n)
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
w_i:=\frac{N}{a_i}
\quad (1\leq i\leq n).$$ Then $B_\mathbf{a}$ admits a positive
$\mathbf{Z}$-grading determined by $\deg(X_i)=w_i$. Since
$$\deg(X_i^{a_i})=a_iw_i=N$$ for every $i$, the polynomial
$f_\mathbf{a}=X_1^{a_1}+\cdots+X_n^{a_n}$ is homogeneous of degree $N$.
Consequently, this grading induces a $\mathbf{G}_{m,k}$-action on
$V_\mathbf{a}$ given by $$t\cdot(x_1,\ldots,x_n)
= (t^{w_1}x_1,\ldots,t^{w_n}x_n),
\qquad
t\in\mathbf{G}_{m,k}.$$

Since all weights $w_i$ are strictly positive, the induced grading on
$B_\mathbf{a}$ is positive. Moreover, the only homogeneous elements of
degree $0$ are the constants, so $(B_\mathbf{a})_0=k$. Its unique fixed
point is the vertex $\mathbf{0}_\mathbf{a}\in V_\mathbf{a}$,
corresponding to the homogeneous maximal ideal
$(X_1,\ldots,X_n)=(B_\mathbf{a})_+$. Furthermore, for every point
$x=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\in V_\mathbf{a}$, the orbit map
$$\mathbf{G}_{m,k}\longrightarrow V_\mathbf{a},
\qquad
t\longmapsto
(t^{w_1}x_1,\ldots,t^{w_n}x_n),$$ extends to a morphism
$\mathbf{A}^1_k\to V_\mathbf{a}$ by sending $0$ to
$\mathbf{0}_\mathbf{a}$, since $w_i>0$ for all $i$. Consequently,
$\mathbf{0}_\mathbf{a}$ belongs to the closure of every
$\mathbf{G}_{m,k}$-orbit. Under our standing assumptions,
$\mathbf{0}_\mathbf{a}$ is the unique singular point of $V_\mathbf{a}$.
Since $\mathbf{0}_\mathbf{a}$ is the unique fixed point of the action,
the above $\mathbf{G}_{m,k}$-action on $V_\mathbf{a}$ is good.\
Since the proofs rely heavily on complex analytic methods, we briefly
recall some notions from complex analytic geometry that will be used
throughout this section.

### A quick glimpse of complex analytic geometry {#subse2.2}

An *analytic space* is a locally ringed space $(X,\mathcal{H}_X)$
locally isomorphic to a closed complex analytic subspace of an open
subset of $\mathbf{C}^n$ under the usual complex Euclidean topology. If
$(X,\mathcal{H}_X)$ is an analytic space and $x \in X$, then the pair
$(X,x)$ is called an *analytic germ* modulo the equivalence that two
such pairs $(X,x)$ and $(Y,y)$ are said to be *analytically isomorphic*
(or *analytically equivalent*) if there exist open neighbourhoods
$M(x) \subseteq X$ of $x$ and $N(y) \subseteq Y$ of $y$ under the usual
complex topology, together with an isomorphism of analytic spaces
$$\varphi : M(x) \xrightarrow{\sim} N(y)$$ such that $\varphi(x)=y$.

Now let $X$ be a complex algebraic variety. Then $X$ has the structure
sheaf $\mathcal{O}_X$ under the Zariski topology. On the other hand,
associated to $X$ is a natural analytic space
$(X^{\rm an},\mathcal{O}^{\rm an}_X)$ obtained by endowing $X$ with the
sheaf $\mathcal{O}^{\rm an}_X$ of holomorphic functions. For a point
$x \in X$, we denote by $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ and
$\mathcal{O}^{\rm an}_{X,x}$ the corresponding algebraic and analytic
local ring at $x$, respectively. By this, $X$ is also regarded as an
analytic space.

If $(X,x)$ and $(Y,y)$ are germs of complex algebraic varieties, then
they are said to be *analytically isomorphic* if the associated analytic
germs $(X^{\rm an},x)$ and $(Y^{\rm an},y)$ are analytically isomorphic.

We shall use the following fundamental characterization: two analytic
germs $(X,x)$ and $(Y,y)$ are analytically isomorphic if and only if
their completed local rings $\widehat{\mathcal{H}}_{X,x}$ and
$\widehat{\mathcal{H}}_{Y,y}$ are isomorphic as $\mathbf{C}$-algebras.

An *algebroid space* is defined by the ideals of the formal power series
ring over $\mathbf{C}$. Throughout, we shall denote by $\widehat{(X,x)}$
the formal completion of a complex analytic space germ $(X,x)$, which is
an algebroid space.

::: {#Thm: Artin's approximation .thm}
**Theorem 1** (Hironaka--Rossi, Artin; cf. [@Ish2014 Theorem 4.2.3]).
*Let $(X,x)$ and $(Y,y)$ be germs of analytic spaces. Then the following
are equivalent:*

1.  *$(X,x)$ is analytically equivalent to $(Y,y)$;*

2.  *There exists an isomorphism of $\mathbf{C}$-algebras
    $\widehat{\mathcal{H}}_{X,x}\simeq \widehat{\mathcal{H}}_{Y,y}$;*

3.  *There exists an isomorphism of $\mathbf{C}$-algebras
    $\mathcal{H}_{X,x}\simeq \mathcal{H}_{Y,y}$.*
:::

::: {#Thm: Artin's algebraization .thm}
**Theorem 2** (Artin's Algebraization Theorem; cf. [@Ish2014 Theorem
4.2.4]). *For a germ $(X,x)$ of an analytic space, if $x$ is an isolated
singularity, then there exists an algebraic variety $A$ over
$\mathbf{C}$ and a point $P \in A$ such that $(X,x)=(A,P)$.*
:::

After Artin's algebraization theorem, as remarked by Ishii, when
studying isolated singularities on analytic spaces, one may always
assume that they arise from isolated singularities on algebraic
varieties. Henceforth, unless otherwise stated, (a germ of) an isolated
singularity $(X,x)$ will mean that $X$ is an algebraic variety and
$\mathcal{O}_X$ denotes its structure sheaf in the Zariski topology.

### Generalized cancellation for analytic space germs {#subse2.3}

The following two results from [@HM1990] are fundamental tools for our
subsequent arguments. They provide a unique factorization theory for
algebroid spaces and analytic space germs, which will be crucial in
identifying and comparing product decompositions.

::: defn
**Definition 3**. An algebroid space $V$ is *decomposable* if there are
non-trivial algebroid spaces $V_1$ and $V_2$ (i.e., different from the
reduced point) such that $V\cong V_1 \times V_2$. And $V$ is called
*indecomposable* if it is not decomposable.
:::

::: {#Thm: H-M_Unique factorization for algebroid spaces .thm}
**Theorem 4** ([@HM1990 Theorem 2]; Unique factorization property of
algebroid spaces).

*For any non-trivial algebroid space $Z$ there exist a unique integer
$p$ and non-trivial indecomposable algebroid spaces $Z_1,\ldots,Z_p$,
unique up to permutation and isomorphism, such that
$$Z \cong Z_1 \times \cdots \times Z_p.$$*
:::

The analytic version of this statement remains open in general. However,
it does hold if the germ is algebraic (i.e., Nash analytic), i.e., if it
can be defined by a power series which in suitable coordinates is
algebraic over the ring of polynomials:

::: {#Thm: H-M_Unique factorization for analytic space germs .thm}
**Theorem 5** (cf. [@HM1990 Theorem 3]; Unique factorization property of
algebraic analytic space germs).

*For any non-trivial algebraic analytic space germ $Z$ there exist a
unique integer $p$ and non-trivial indecomposable analytic space germs
$Z_1,\dots,Z_p$, unique up to permutation and isomorphism, such that
$$Z \cong Z_1 \times \cdots \times Z_p.$$ The factors $Z_i$ are
algebraic. Moreover, passing to completions, this decomposition
coincides with the factorization of $\widehat{Z}$ into indecomposable
algebroid spaces.*

## **Proofs of the Main Results**

### Exponent rigidity for Brieskorn--Pham varieties {#subse3.1}

The following elementary lemma is the key ingredient for the exponent
rigidity phenomenon for the Brieskorn--Pham varieties.

::: {#Lem: Key Lemma .lem}
**Lemma 6**. *Let $\mathbf{a}=(a_1,\ldots,a_r)\in\mathbf{N}^r$ and
$\mathbf{b}=(b_1,\ldots,b_s)\in\mathbf{N}^s$ satisfy
$$1\le a_1\le \cdots\le a_r
\quad\text{and}\quad
1\le b_1\le \cdots\le b_s,$$ where $1\leq r,s\le n$. Define
$$R:=\frac{k[X_1,\ldots,X_n]}{(X_1^{a_1},\ldots,X_r^{a_r})}
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
S:=\frac{k[X_1,\ldots,X_n]}{(X_1^{b_1},\ldots,X_s^{b_s})}.$$ If
$R\cong_{k\text{-alg}} S$, then $r=s$ and $a_i=b_i$ for all
$1\le i\le r$.*
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Since $R\cong_{k\text{-alg}} S$, the rings $R$ and $S$ have the
same Krull dimensions. Since $\dim(R)=n-r$ and $\dim(S)=n-s$, it follows
that $r=s$.

Let $\varphi:R\xrightarrow{\sim}S$ be a $k$-algebra isomorphism. Let
$\mathfrak{N}_R$ and $\mathfrak{N}_S$ denote the nilradicals of $R$ and
$S$, respectively. Since ring isomorphisms preserve nilpotency,
$\varphi(\mathfrak N_R)=\mathfrak N_S$ and hence
$\varphi(\mathfrak N_R^m)=\mathfrak N_S^m$ for every $m\ge0$, and
therefore $\varphi$ induces isomorphisms
$\mathfrak N_R^m/\mathfrak N_R^{m+1} \cong
\mathfrak N_S^m/\mathfrak N_S^{m+1}$. Thus, we obtain
$$\operatorname{gr}_{\mathfrak{N}_R}(R)
:=
\bigoplus_{m\geq 0}
\frac{\mathfrak{N}_R^m}{\mathfrak{N}_R^{m+1}}
\cong_k
\bigoplus_{m\geq 0}
\frac{\mathfrak{N}_S^m}{\mathfrak{N}_S^{m+1}}
=: \operatorname{gr}_{\mathfrak{N}_S}(S).$$ as graded $k$-algebras.
Therefore,
$H_{\operatorname{gr}_{\mathfrak{N}_R}(R)}(t)= H_{\operatorname{gr}_{\mathfrak{N}_S}(S)}(t)$,
where $H_{A}$ denotes the Hilbert series of a $k$-algebra $A$.

It is well-known that,
$$\chi^k(T/I, T/J)(t) :=\sum\limits_{i\geq 0}(-1)^i H_{\operatorname{Tor}^k_i(T/I,T/J)}(t)=\frac{H_{T/I}(t)\cdot H_{T/J}(t)}{H_{k}(t)},$$
as Laurent polynomial in $\mathbf{Z}(\!(t)\!)$, for $T$ being a
polynomial ring over $k$ and $I, J \subseteq T$ two ideals of $T$, see
[@AB1993]. Since all $k$-vector spaces are flat $k$-modules,
$\operatorname{Tor}^k_i(T/I,T/J)=0$ for $i>0$. Thus, the above formula
yields that $$\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mult_of_Hilbert_series}
    H_{T/I\otimes_k T/J}(t)=H_{T/I}(t)\cdot H_{T/J}(t),
\end{equation}$$ as $H_{k}(t)=1 \in \mathbf{Z}(\!(t)\!)$.

Observe that $\mathfrak{N}_R=(\bar{X}_1,\ldots,\bar{X}_r)$, where
$\bar{X}_i$ denotes the image of $X_i$ in $R$. Therefore the quotient
$\mathfrak N_R^m/\mathfrak N_R^{m+1}$ naturally gets an
$R/\mathfrak{N}_R$-module structure, and
$R/\mathfrak{N}_R \cong k[X_{r+1},\ldots,X_n]$. Moreover, it is evident
that $\mathfrak N_R^m/\mathfrak N_R^{m+1}$ is a free
$k[X_{r+1},\ldots,X_n]$-module with basis consisting of the images of
the monomials $$\{\bar{X}_1^{i_1}\cdots \bar{X}_r^{i_r}
\mid
i_1+\cdots+i_r=m,\;
0\le i_j<a_j
\}.$$ Consequently, $$\operatorname{gr}_{\mathfrak N_R}(R)
\cong
k[X_{r+1},\ldots,X_n]
\otimes_k
\frac{k[U_1,\ldots,U_r]}
{(U_1^{a_1},\ldots,U_r^{a_r})},$$ where each $U_i$ is homogeneous of
degree $1$. Similarly, $$\operatorname{gr}_{\mathfrak{N}_S}(S)
\cong
k[X_{r+1},\ldots,X_n]
\otimes_k
\frac{k[V_1,\ldots,V_r]}
{(V_1^{b_1},\ldots,V_r^{b_r})},$$ where each $V_i$ is homogeneous of
degree $1$.

Since Hilbert series are multiplicative under tensor products of graded
$k$-algebras, we obtain $$H_{\operatorname{gr}_{\mathfrak{N}_R}(R)}(t)
=
\prod_{i=1}^{r}
(1+t+\cdots+t^{a_i-1})
\cdot
\left(\sum_{\ell\geq 0} t^\ell\right)^{n-r},$$ and
$$H_{\operatorname{gr}_{\mathfrak{N}_S}(S)}(t)
=
\prod_{i=1}^{r}
(1+t+\cdots+t^{b_i-1})
\cdot
\left(\sum_{\ell\geq 0} t^\ell\right)^{n-r}.$$ Since these two Hilbert
series are equal, it follows that $$\prod_{i=1}^{r}
(1+t+\cdots+t^{a_i-1})
=
\prod_{i=1}^{r}
(1+t+\cdots+t^{b_i-1}),$$ and hence $$\begin{equation}
\label{eq:key}
\prod_{i=1}^{r}(1-t^{a_i})
=
\prod_{i=1}^{r}(1-t^{b_i}).
\end{equation}$$

Let $p$ and $q$ be the largest indices such that $a_1=\cdots=a_p$ and
$b_1=\cdots=b_q$, respectively, for some $1\leq p,\, q\leq r$. Expanding
both sides of [\[eq:key\]](#eq:key){reference-type="eqref"
reference="eq:key"}, we obtain $$\begin{equation}
\label{eq:key1}
1-pt^{a_1}+P(t)=1-qt^{b_1}+Q(t),
\end{equation}$$ where $P(t),Q(t)\in\mathbf{Z}[t]$ satisfy
$\operatorname{ord}_t(P)>a_1$ and $\operatorname{ord}_t(Q)>b_1$, i.e.,
$P(t)$ and $Q(t)$ contain only terms of degree strictly greater than
$a_1$ and $b_1$, respectively. Comparing the lowest nonconstant terms
shows that $a_1=b_1$ and $p=q$. Therefore $a_i=b_i$ for $1\leq i\leq p$.
Cancelling the common factors $(1-t^{a_1})^p=(1-t^{b_1})^p$ from
[\[eq:key\]](#eq:key){reference-type="eqref" reference="eq:key"}, we
obtain $$\begin{equation}
\label{eq:key2}
\prod_{i=p+1}^{r}(1-t^{a_i})
=
\prod_{i=p+1}^{r}(1-t^{b_i}).
\end{equation}$$ Repeating the same argument inductively yields
$a_i=b_i$ for $1\leq i\leq r$. Hence $r=s$ and $a_i=b_i$ for all
$1\leq i\leq r$. This completes the proof. ◻

varieties over a field $k$ of characteristic $0$ corresponding to
exponent tuples $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\in(\mathbf{N}_{\ge2})^n$ for
$n\geq 2$. Then $V_\mathbf{a}\cong_k V_\mathbf{b}$ if and only if
$\mathbf{a}\sim \mathbf{b}$, i.e., $\mathbf{a}=\mathbf{b}$ up to
permutation of entries.*
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* The implication
"$\mathbf{a}\sim\mathbf{b}\Rightarrow V_\mathbf{a}\cong_k V_\mathbf{b}$"
is obvious by permuting the coordinates. We prove the converse. Assume
that $V_\mathbf{a}\cong_k V_\mathbf{b}$. Let $\bar{k}$ be an algebraic
closure of $k$. Base-changing the given isomorphism to $\bar{k}$ yields
$V_{\mathbf{a},\bar{k}}\cong_{\bar{k}} V_{\mathbf{b},\bar{k}}$, where
$$V_{\mathbf{a},\bar{k}}:=V_\mathbf{a}\times_{\operatorname{Spec}k} \operatorname{Spec}\bar{k}=\operatorname{Spec}B_{\mathbf{a},\bar{k}}= \operatorname{Spec}(B_\mathbf{a}\otimes_k \bar{k})=\operatorname{Spec}\!\left(
\frac{\bar{k}[X_1,\ldots,X_n]}
{(X_1^{a_1}+\cdots+X_n^{a_n})}
\right),$$ and the same for $V_{\mathbf{b},\bar{k}}$. Let
$f_\mathbf{a}:=X_1^{a_1}+\cdots+X_n^{a_n}$, and
$f_\mathbf{b}:=X_1^{b_1}+\cdots+X_n^{b_n}$. Since the scheme-theoretic
singular locus is preserved under isomorphisms, the above
$\bar{k}$-isomorphism induces an isomorphism
$\operatorname{Sing}(V_{\mathbf{a},\bar{k}})\cong_{\bar{k}} \operatorname{Sing}(V_{\mathbf{b},\bar{k}})$
as $\bar{k}$-schemes.

Since $V_{\mathbf{a}, \bar{k}}$ is a hypersurface defined over
$\bar{k}$, the Jacobian criterion yields,
$$\operatorname{Sing}(V_{\mathbf{a},\bar{k}})
=
\operatorname{Spec}\!\left(
\frac{\bar{k}[X_1,\ldots,X_n]}
{(f_\mathbf{a},\partial_1f_\mathbf{a},\ldots,\partial_nf_\mathbf{a})}
\right),$$ where $\partial_i\equiv\frac{\partial}{\partial X_i}$ for all
$1 \le i \le n$. Since $\partial_i f_\mathbf{a}=a_iX_i^{a_i-1}$ for
every $1\le i\le n$ and
$\operatorname{char}(k)=\operatorname{char}(\bar{k})=0$, we have
$$f_\mathbf{a}
=
\sum_{i=1}^n
{a_i}^{-1}
X_i\frac{\partial f_\mathbf{a}}{\partial X_i}
\in
(\partial_1f_\mathbf{a},\ldots,\partial_nf_\mathbf{a}).$$ Hence
$(f_\mathbf{a},\partial_1f_\mathbf{a},\ldots,\partial_nf_\mathbf{a})
=
(X_1^{a_1-1},\ldots,X_n^{a_n-1}) \subseteq \bar{k}[X_1,\ldots,X_n]$, and
therefore $$\operatorname{Sing}(V_{\mathbf{a},\bar{k}})
=
\operatorname{Spec}\!\left(
\frac{\bar{k}[X_1,\ldots,X_n]}
{(X_1^{a_1-1},\ldots,X_n^{a_n-1})}
\right) \quad \text{and} \quad \operatorname{Sing}(V_{\mathbf{b},\bar{k}})
=
\operatorname{Spec}\!\left(
\frac{\bar{k}[X_1,\ldots,X_n]}
{(X_1^{b_1-1},\ldots,X_n^{b_n-1})}
\right).$$ Since
$\operatorname{Sing}(V_{\mathbf{a},\bar{k}})\cong_{\bar{k}}\operatorname{Sing}(V_{\mathbf{b},\bar{k}})$
as affine $\bar{k}$-schemes, it follows that
$$\Gamma(\operatorname{Sing}(V_{\mathbf{a},\bar{k}}),\mathcal O_{\operatorname{Sing}(V_{\mathbf{a},\bar{k}})})
\cong_{\bar{k}}
\Gamma(\operatorname{Sing}(V_{\mathbf{b},\bar{k}}),\mathcal O_{\operatorname{Sing}(V_{\mathbf{b},\bar{k}})}).$$
That is, $$\frac{\bar{k}[X_1,\ldots,X_n]}
{(X_1^{a_1-1},\ldots,X_n^{a_n-1})}
\cong_{\bar{k}\text{-alg}}
\frac{\bar{k}[X_1,\ldots,X_n]}
{(X_1^{b_1-1},\ldots,X_n^{b_n-1})}.$$ Therefore,
Lemma [6](#Lem: Key Lemma){reference-type="ref"
reference="Lem: Key Lemma"} yields
$$(a_1-1,\ldots,a_n-1)\sim(b_1-1,\ldots,b_n-1),$$ and hence

### Generalized Zariski cancellation for good $\mathbf{C}^*$-varieties with a unique singularity {#subse3.2}

We begin with the following elementary observation, which will be used
repeatedly in the proof of the main theorem of this subsection.

::: {#Lem: Isolated implies indecomposable .lem}
**Lemma 9**. *Let $X$ be a connected algebroid space of positive
dimension with an isolated singularity. Then $X$ is indecomposable.*
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Suppose that $X \cong Y \times Z$ for algebroid spaces $Y$ and
$Z$. Since $\dim(X)>0$, at least one of the factors has positive
dimension. Without loss of generality, assume that $\dim(Y)>0$. Clearly
$$\operatorname{Sing}(X)
=
(\operatorname{Sing}(Y)\times Z)
\cup
(Y\times \operatorname{Sing}(Z)),$$ and hence
$$\dim(\operatorname{Sing}(X))
=
\max\{
\dim(\operatorname{Sing}(Y))+\dim(Z),
\,
\dim(Y)+\dim(\operatorname{Sing}(Z))
\}.$$ Since $X$ has an isolated singularity, we have
$\dim(\operatorname{Sing}(X))=0$. As $\dim(Y)>0$, the equality above
forces $$\dim(Z)=0
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\operatorname{Sing}(Z)=\varnothing.$$ Thus $Z$ is a smooth
zero-dimensional connected algebroid space, hence a reduced point.
Therefore $X \cong Y$, showing that $X$ is indecomposable. ◻
:::

::: rem
**Remark 2**. In the above proof, we adopt the convention that
$\dim(\varnothing)=-\infty$.
:::

We now prove the key technical result from which the main theorem of
this subsection follows.

::: {#Thm: Our main cancellation theorem .thm}
**Theorem 10**. *Let $X$ and $Y$ be connected (not necessarily
irreducible) algebraic varieties over $\mathbf{C}$, each having a unique
singular point, say $P\in X$ and $Q\in Y$. Let $Z$ be a separated scheme
over $\mathbf{C}$ (not necessarily connected) having a smooth point such
that $$X\times Z \cong_{\mathbf{C}} Y\times Z.$$ Then the analytic germs
$(X,P)$ and $(Y,Q)$ are analytically isomorphic.*
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Let $\varphi:X\times Z \xrightarrow{\sim} Y\times Z$ be an
isomorphism. Put $n:=\dim(X)=\dim(Y)$.

Choose a smooth point $z_0\in Z$. Since $z_0$ is smooth, it belongs to a
unique irreducible component of $Z$. Let $m$ denote the dimension of
that irreducible component. Thus,
$(Z,z_0)\cong (\mathbf{C}^m,\mathbf{0})$.

**Claim.**

*There exist a non-negative integer
$\ell \leq \lfloor \frac{m}{n}\rfloor$ and a sequence of points
${z_0,\ldots,z_\ell}\subseteq Z$ satisfying the following two
properties:*

1.  for all $0\leq i\leq \ell-1$, $\varphi(P,z_i)=(y_{i+1},z_{i+1})$,
    where $y_{i+1}\in Y^{\rm sm}$, and $\varphi(P,z_\ell)=(Q,w_\ell)$
    for some $w_\ell\in Z$, i.e., $\ell$ is the least non-negative
    integer such that the projection of $\varphi(P,z_\ell)$ onto $Y$ is
    $Q$;

2.  for all $0\leq i\leq \ell$, $$\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn1}
    \widehat{(Z,z_i)}
    \cong
    \underbrace{\widehat{(X,P)}\times \cdots \times \widehat{(X,P)}}_{i\text{ copies}}
    \times
    \widehat{(\mathbf{C}^{m-in},\mathbf{0})}.
    \end{equation}$$

*Proof of the claim.* Clearly $z_0$ satisfies
[\[eqn1\]](#eqn1){reference-type="eqref" reference="eqn1"}.

If $\varphi(P,z_0)=(Q,w)$ for some $w\in Z$, then we choose $\ell=0$ and
the claim follows. Thus, assume that the projection of $\varphi(P,z_0)$
onto $Y$ is not $Q$.

Let $i>0$ and suppose that ${z_0,\ldots,z_{i-1}}$ has been chosen
satisfying:

1.  for all $0\leq j\leq i-2$, $\varphi(P,z_j)=(y_{j+1},z_{j+1})$, where
    $y_{j+1}\in Y^{\rm sm}$;

2.  for all $0\leq j\leq i-1$, $$\widehat{(Z,z_j)}
    \cong
    \underbrace{\widehat{(X,P)}\times \cdots \times \widehat{(X,P)}}_{j\text{ copies}}
    \times
    \widehat{(\mathbf{C}^{m-jn},\mathbf{0})}.$$

Exactly one of the following two cases can occur.

**Case 1.** *$\varphi(P,z_{i-1})=(Q,w_{i-1})$ for some $w_{i-1}\in Z$.*

In this case, we set $\ell=i-1$, and the required sequence has been
obtained.

**Case 2.** *The projection of $\varphi(P,z_{i-1})$ onto $Y$ is a smooth
point, say $y_i\in Y^{\rm sm}$.*

Define $z_i$ to be the projection of $\varphi(P,z_{i-1})$ onto $Z$.
Since $\varphi$ is an isomorphism, it induces an isomorphism of
algebroid spaces $$\widehat{(X,P)}
\times
\widehat{(Z,z_{i-1})}
\cong
\widehat{(Y,y_i)}
\times
\widehat{(Z,z_i)}.$$

Using the induction hypothesis, we obtain $$\begin{equation}
\label{eqn2}
\underbrace{\widehat{(X,P)}\times \cdots \times \widehat{(X,P)}}_{i\text{ copies}}
\times
\widehat{(\mathbf{C}^{m-n(i-1)},\mathbf{0})}
\cong
\widehat{(\mathbf{C}^n,\mathbf{0})}
\times
\widehat{(Z,z_i)}.
\end{equation}$$

We claim that $m\geq in$. Suppose otherwise. Then $m<in$, and therefore
$m-n(i-1)<n$. Applying Hauser--Müller's cancellation theorem [@HM1990
Theorem 1] to [\[eqn2\]](#eqn2){reference-type="eqref"
reference="eqn2"}, we obtain
$$\underbrace{\widehat{(X,P)}\times \cdots \times \widehat{(X,P)}}_{i\text{ copies}}
\cong
\widehat{(\mathbf{C}^{in-m},\mathbf{0})}
\times
\widehat{(Z,z_i)}.$$ Since $in-m>0$, the right-hand side contains
$\widehat{(\mathbf{C},0)}$ as an indecomposable factor. On the other
hand, the left-hand side does not contain $\widehat{(\mathbf{C},0)}$ as
an indecomposable factor because $\widehat{(X,P)}$ is indecomposable by
Lemma [9](#Lem: Isolated implies indecomposable){reference-type="ref"
reference="Lem: Isolated implies indecomposable"}, and
$\widehat{(X,P)}\not\cong \widehat{(\mathbf{C},0)}$ since $P$ is a
singular point of $X$. This contradicts the uniqueness of factorization
theorem for algebroid spaces due to Hauser--Müller (Theorem
[4](#Thm: H-M_Unique factorization for algebroid spaces){reference-type="ref"
reference="Thm: H-M_Unique factorization for algebroid spaces"}). Hence
$m\geq in$, as claimed. Applying Hauser--Müller's cancellation theorem
once again to [\[eqn2\]](#eqn2){reference-type="eqref"
reference="eqn2"}, we obtain
$$\underbrace{\widehat{(X,P)}\times \cdots \times \widehat{(X,P)}}_{i\text{ copies}}
\times
\widehat{(\mathbf{C}^{m-in},\mathbf{0})}
\cong
\widehat{(Z,z_i)},$$ whence $z_i$ satisfies
[\[eqn1\]](#eqn1){reference-type="eqref" reference="eqn1"}.

If Case $1$ never occurs, then Case $2$ occurs for every positive
integer $i$. By the above argument, this would imply that $m\geq in$ for
every positive integer $i$, which is impossible for $i>\frac{m}{n}$.
Therefore Case $1$ must occur for some non-negative integer
$\ell\leq \lfloor \frac{m}{n}\rfloor$. This proves the claim. 0◻

*Proof of Theorem
[10](#Thm: Our main cancellation theorem){reference-type="ref"
reference="Thm: Our main cancellation theorem"} continued.* Since
$\varphi(P,z_\ell)=(Q,w_\ell)$, the isomorphism $\varphi$ induces an
isomorphism of algebroid spaces $$\widehat{(X,P)}
\times
\widehat{(Z,z_\ell)}
\cong
\widehat{(Y,Q)}
\times
\widehat{(Z,w_\ell)}.$$

Using [\[eqn1\]](#eqn1){reference-type="eqref" reference="eqn1"}, we
obtain
$$\underbrace{\widehat{(X,P)}\times \cdots \times \widehat{(X,P)}}_{\ell+1\text{ copies}}
\times
\widehat{(\mathbf{C}^{m-n\ell},\mathbf{0})}
\cong
\widehat{(Y,Q)}
\times
\widehat{(Z,w_\ell)}.$$

By Lemma [9](#Lem: Isolated implies indecomposable){reference-type="ref"
reference="Lem: Isolated implies indecomposable"}, both
$\widehat{(X,P)}$ and $\widehat{(Y,Q)}$ are indecomposable algebroid
spaces. By the uniqueness of factorization theorem for algebroid spaces
due to Hauser--Müller (Theorem
[4](#Thm: H-M_Unique factorization for algebroid spaces){reference-type="ref"
reference="Thm: H-M_Unique factorization for algebroid spaces"}), the
indecomposable factor $\widehat{(Y,Q)}$ must occur among the
indecomposable factors on the left-hand side. Now, the indecomposable
factors occurring on the left-hand side are the $\ell+1$ copies of
$\widehat{(X,P)}$ and, if $m-n\ell>0$, the $m-n\ell$ copies of
$\widehat{(\mathbf{C},0)}$. Since $Q$ is a singular point of $Y$, we
have $\widehat{(Y,Q)}\not\cong\widehat{(\mathbf{C},\mathbf{0})}$.
Therefore, $\widehat{(Y,Q)}\cong \widehat{(X,P)}$.

Finally, by Artin's approximation theorem (Theorem
[1](#Thm: Artin's approximation){reference-type="ref"
reference="Thm: Artin's approximation"}), this formal isomorphism
algebraizes to an analytic isomorphism of complex analytic germs. Hence,
$(X,P)\cong (Y,Q)$. This completes the proof. ◻

**Remark 3**. Applying Corollary
[11](#Cor: Cancellation theorem for isolated singularities){reference-type="ref"

inverse isomorphism
$\varphi^{-1}: Y\times Z \xrightarrow{\sim} X\times Z$, it follows that
the sets of analytic isomorphism classes of isolated singularity germs
occurring on $X$ and $Y$ coincide. More precisely, for any analytic
singularity type $\tau$, let
$$\Sigma_X(\tau):=\{P\in \operatorname{Sing}(X)\mid (X,P)\text{ is of type }\tau\}
\quad \text{and} \quad
\Sigma_Y(\tau):=\{Q\in \operatorname{Sing}(Y)\mid (Y,Q)\text{ is of type }\tau\}.$$
Then $$\Sigma_X(\tau)\neq \varnothing

\Sigma_Y(\tau)\neq \varnothing.$$ In other words, $X$ and $Y$ have
exactly the same strata of analytic singularity types.

result (Lemma [12](#Lem: Gurjar's result){reference-type="ref"

Hence $V$ and $W$ are isomorphic as complex affine varieties. ◻

**Remark 4**. Observe that if $Z$ is further assumed to be smooth in
Theorem [13](#Thm: Our main cancellation theorem for C*-varieties){reference-type="ref"
reference="Thm: Our main cancellation theorem for C*-varieties"}, then
it suffices to assume that $p$ is the unique singular point of $V$.
Indeed, since $Z$ is smooth,
$$\operatorname{Sing}(V\times Z)=\operatorname{Sing}(V)\times Z=\{p\}\times Z
\quad
\text{and}\quad 
\operatorname{Sing}(W\times Z)=\operatorname{Sing}(W)\times Z.$$ Hence
the isomorphism $V\times Z\xrightarrow{\sim} W\times Z$ induces an
isomorphism $Z\xrightarrow{\sim} \operatorname{Sing}(W)\times Z$.
Comparing dimensions, we obtain $\dim(\operatorname{Sing}(W))=0$. Since
$\operatorname{Sing}(W)$ is a closed subvariety of the affine variety
$W$, it follows that $\operatorname{Sing}(W)$ is a finite set of points.
If $\operatorname{Sing}(W)=\{s_1,\ldots,s_r\}$ consisting of $r$ points
($r>0$), then
$$\operatorname{Sing}(W)\times Z=\bigsqcup_{i=1}^{r} \left(\{s_i\}\times Z\right).$$
Since $\operatorname{Sing}(W)\times Z\cong Z$, comparison of the numbers
of connected components yields $r=1$. Thus $W$ has a unique singular
point. Since the vertex $q$ is fixed by the good $\mathbf{C}^*$-action,
this unique singular point must be $q$. Therefore the conclusion of
Theorem [13](#Thm: Our main cancellation theorem for C*-varieties){reference-type="ref"
reference="Thm: Our main cancellation theorem for C*-varieties"} remains
valid under the weaker assumption that only $p$ is the unique singular
point of $V$.

*Proof.* With the earlier notations, let
$V_\mathbf{a}=\operatorname{Spec}B_\mathbf{a}$ and
$V_\mathbf{b}=\operatorname{Spec}B_\mathbf{b}$, where $B_\mathbf{a}$ and
$B_\mathbf{b}$ are the corresponding Brieskorn--Pham hypersurface rings,
and let $\mathbf{0}_\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{0}_\mathbf{b}$ denote the
unique singular points of $V_\mathbf{a}$ and $V_\mathbf{b}$,
respectively. Recall from Section [2.1](#subse2.1){reference-type="ref"

$V_\mathbf{a}$ and $V_\mathbf{b}$ admit good $\mathbf{C}^*$-actions with

B_\mathbf{b}=
\frac{\mathbf{C}[Y_1,\ldots,Y_n]}
{(Y_1^{b_1}+\cdots+Y_n^{b_n})},$$ and let $x_i$ and $y_i$ denote the
images of $X_i$ and $Y_i$ in $B_\mathbf{a}$ and $B_\mathbf{b}$,
respectively, for $i=1,\ldots,n$. Consider the $\mathbf{C}$-algebra
homomorphism $\varphi:B_\mathbf{b}\longrightarrow B_\mathbf{a}$ defined
by $\varphi(y_i)=x_{\sigma(i)}$ for all $i=1,\ldots,n$. Since
$b_i=a_{\sigma(i)}$, we have
$$\varphi\!\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i^{b_i}\right)
=
\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{\sigma(i)}^{a_{\sigma(i)}}
=
\sum_{j=1}^{n}x_j^{a_j},$$ and hence $\varphi$ is well-defined. Its
inverse is induced by the inverse permutation $\sigma^{-1}$, so
$\varphi$ is a $\mathbf{C}$-algebra isomorphism.

Let $N=\operatorname{lcm}(a_1,\ldots,a_n) =
\operatorname{lcm}(b_1,\ldots,b_n)$. For each $i=1,\ldots,n$, put
$w_i=\frac{N}{a_i}$ and $w_i'=\frac{N}{b_i}$. By
Section [2.1](#subse2.1){reference-type="ref" reference="subse2.1"}, the
good $\mathbf{C}^*$-actions on $V_\mathbf{a}$ and $V_\mathbf{b}$ are
induced by the positive gradings on $B_\mathbf{a}$ and $B_\mathbf{b}$
determined by $\deg(x_i)=w_i$ and $\deg(y_i)=w_i'$, respectively. Since
$b_i=a_{\sigma(i)}$, we obtain
$$\deg(y_i)=w_i'=\frac{N}{b_i}=\frac{N}{a_{\sigma(i)}}=w_{\sigma(i)}=\deg(x_{\sigma(i)})$$
for every $i=1,\ldots,n$. Therefore, $\varphi$ preserves the degrees,
and thus it is a graded isomorphism of graded $\mathbf{C}$-algebras.
Moreover, for every $t\in\mathbf{C}^*$ and every generator $y_i$ of
$B_\mathbf{b}$, we have
$$\varphi(t\cdot y_i)=\varphi(t^{w_i'}y_i)=t^{w_i'}x_{\sigma(i)}=t^{w_{\sigma(i)}}x_{\sigma(i)}=t\cdot x_{\sigma(i)}=t\cdot\varphi(y_i).$$
Since $y_1,\ldots,y_n$ generate $B_\mathbf{b}$ as a
$\mathbf{C}$-algebra, it follows that $\varphi$ intertwines the
corresponding $\mathbf{C}^*$-actions on $B_\mathbf{b}$ and
$B_\mathbf{a}$. Consequently, the induced isomorphism
$$\varphi^*:V_\mathbf{a}\longrightarrow V_\mathbf{b}$$ is
$\mathbf{C}^*$-equivariant. Thus $V_\mathbf{a}$ and $V_\mathbf{b}$ are
isomorphic as $\mathbf{C}^*$-varieties.

The implications $\rm(3)\implies\rm(2)\implies\rm(1)$ are
straightforward. Finally, the implication
$\textup{(1)}\implies\textup{(4)}$ follows from
Theorem [10](#Thm: Our main cancellation theorem){reference-type="ref"
reference="Thm: Our main cancellation theorem"} together with
Corollary [8](#Cor: Exponent rigidity of B-P variety in analytic setting over complex numbers){reference-type="ref"
reference="Cor: Exponent rigidity of B-P variety in analytic setting over complex numbers"}.
This completes the proof. ◻
